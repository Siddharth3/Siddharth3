## 🫣 Little more
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal AI-powered assistant, which can help me in my daily tasks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, like how different algo's use to predict data and NLP works.
- 🤔 I recently build a [Cab Service Data Dashboard](https://github.com/Siddharth3/CabServiceDataAnalysis), offers a comprehensive view of the cab service data, focusing on key metrics such as total bookings, canceled rides, top-performing customers, and revenue breakdown. It highlights critical insights, including the reasons for ride cancellations, top revenue-generating customers, and booking trends by vehicle type.
